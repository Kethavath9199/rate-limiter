bottlenecks

1. Network Latency & token size 
Microservices communicating over the network may experience increased latency due to additional round-trips for authentication and authorization with Keycloak

Mitigation: 
    By implementing token caching at the API Gateway or microservices. Cached tokens can be reused for subsequent requests within their validity period.

    token size: token compression, and remove unsed info from token 

2. Scalability
Keycloak needs to scale to handle authentication requests from multiple microservices and clients, which may result in performance bottlenecks under high loads.

Mitigation:
    Deploy Keycloak in a clustered configuration to distribute the authentication load across multiple instances. Load balancers can distribute incoming requests evenly among the Keycloak nodes.
    Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

3. Dependency on Keycloak  (single point of failure)
mitigation:
    Fallback Mechanisms: Implement fallback mechanisms or circuit breakers in microservices to handle Keycloak server failures gracefully.
    Redundancy and High Availability: Deploy Keycloak in a highly available configuration.
